<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Enterprise ETL Tool is a no-code, configuration-driven ETL orchestration platform designed for adhoc and manual data pipeline execution in enterprise environments. It enables users to dynamically configure, trigger, and monitor end-to-end ETL workflows without writing any code, simplifying complex data movement and transformation processes. The tool supports source and target database connectivity, initial and incremental loads, column selection, filtering, renaming, notification handling, and detailed pipeline history tracking with real-time status updates. It is primarily intended for on-demand use cases such as data migrations, backfills, validation runs, operational support activities, and controlled manual executions, while scheduled workloads can be handled through external batch or scheduling systems. This ETL Tool has been designed, developed, and is actively maintained by Shankara N G, with a strong focus on reliability, flexibility, and enterprise usability through a fully no-code approach.
